# COVID Keyword Mute List
A list of keywords you can add to your mute list to filter out the majority of COVID-related news from social media feeds. Note that this was originally created for Twitter, hence inclusion of specific hashtags. 

In no way is this meant to imply that the current situation is not important. I encourage everyone -- as their mental health allows -- to look to reputable sources for their news, including the bounty of academic research that is emerging weekly on the topic (from epidemiology to economics).
